  App-state sync orchestration helpers, ported from Baileys `resyncAppState`

  patches from the reply, and decodes them through `AppState.Patch` +
  `AppState.SyncAction` into consumer changes — given a key lookup and the prior
  collection state.

  The wire round-trip + storage live in `Connection`; this module is the

  Decode a collection's patches against `state` with `get_key`, returning
  `{:ok, changes, new_state, mismatches}` — `changes` are `SyncAction.decode/1`
  results (`{:chat, _}` / `{:contact, _}` / …); `mismatches` is a list of
  `{:snapshot_mac_mismatch | :patch_mac_mismatch, name}`, one per patch whose
  aggregate collection MAC didn't verify.

  `name` is the collection name — it feeds the snapshot/patch MACs. With
  `validate_macs: true` (default), each patch's **patch MAC** (authenticating the
  patch's mutations) and **snapshot MAC** (authenticating the resulting LTHash) are
  checked against the app-state-sync key, in addition to the per-record value/index
  MACs `Patch.decode_mutations/4` already enforces per record. The two checks are
  NOT equivalent to a single collection abort — ported exactly from Baileys'
  resilience fix (`chat-utils.ts` `decodeSyncdPatch` / `decodePatches`, upstream
  PR #2456), each is handled differently:

  - A **patch MAC** mismatch means the patch's mutations aren't authenticated
    against this collection at all — they are dropped entirely (never decoded),
    exactly as `decodeSyncdPatch` throws before calling `decodeSyncdMutations`.
    The collection version still advances to this patch's version, and decoding
    continues to the next patch — so a single bad patch can no longer freeze the
    collection at the same version forever (the original bug this ports away
    from: the old behavior kept re-requesting the same version, which kept
    hitting the same mismatch).
  - A **snapshot MAC** mismatch means the resulting LTHash doesn't match the
    server's bookkeeping. Since every record's *individual* value/index MAC
    already authenticated it before this check runs, the patch's own mutations
    still apply (matching Baileys applying them before its `break`) — but
    decoding **stops for the rest of this batch**, since subsequent patches'
    hashes are chained onto a state that's now diverged from the server's; they
    are picked up on the next resync instead.

  A patch whose key isn't available yet decodes to no mutations, so there is
  nothing to authenticate (not a mismatch).
